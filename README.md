**Weather App**

**Overview:**
Create a dynamic and user-friendly weather app that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. The app will display essential weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

**Features:**

1. **Location Input:**
   - Users can input the location (city or coordinates) for which they want to check the weather.

2. **Current Weather Display:**
   - Upon submitting the location, the app fetches and displays the current weather conditions for that location.

3. **Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed:**
   - The app provides detailed information about the temperature, humidity, and wind speed to give users a comprehensive overview of the weather.

4. **Weather Description:**
   - A brief description of the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) is displayed to give users a quick summary.

5. **Dynamic Background:**
   - The app features a dynamic background that changes based on the current weather, creating a visually engaging experience for users.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Structure the web page with semantic HTML elements.
- **CSS:** Style the app for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript:** Fetch weather data from a weather API, dynamically update the content, and handle user interactions.

**API Integration:**
Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to retrieve real-time weather data for the specified location.

**How to Use:**
1. Enter the desired location in the input field.
2. Click the "Check Weather" button.
3. View the updated weather information and background based on the current weather conditions.

**Note:**
This project not only provides valuable weather information but also serves as a practical exercise for front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
